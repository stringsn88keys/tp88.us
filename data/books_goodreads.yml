    reason the framing here gave me new perspective… the 4% rule is something I knew

    savings smaller was good as I sit here with an insane mortgage payment.

  review: |-
    It was a valiant attempt to define and educate the audience on the book on what “data science” is. I think it accomplished that, but otherwise the book got lost in the firehose of presenting applications, tools, and methodologies. It was too shallow to be useful and too deep to be absorbed for me.

    It’s a good place to start if you want to further explore what to actually read about or experiment with in data science.

  review: A bit of the usual “hustle” concepts, but also some perspective on both
    the attainability of the goal and also some warnings about the pitfalls in the
    pursuit. Name drops a lot of the usual suspects, but this book is quite a bit
    less fluff than I anticipated. More of a 3.5 star, but not quite a 3 star (on
    my fairly generous scale)

    Intriguing, but also heavy on the sexism and self-importance, given its effectively a memoir written by someone that you wouldn't know of otherwise.

    tl;dr: Silicon Valley success is not deterministic, and success is a roll of the dice weighted by luck, determination, and skill.

  review: Ok, this book made the setup in book 1 a little more worth it. Not wholly
    predictable. Still wore me down a little more than other Star Wars books. Still
    annoyed with the excessive alien fauna metaphors... I know that's a thing in the
    Star Wars universe, but I would have traded Timothy Zahn's one dimensional Han
    Solo for the tedium of species proliferation.

    book to read. Unfortunately, there was a wait list on hold at my library, so I
    had to wait 21+ days before borrowing again.

    and never was really a fan, but this was an enjoyable insight into his life. The
    reading inspired me to go back to his early albums prior to that "big time" moment.
    I recommend the audiobook version, read by Springsteen himself.

    Just in time for the Super Bowl.

    It's one-sided, yes, but I think the NFL has done plenty of one-sided story telling themselves. I think there's an urgent need for this message, in an age in which kids are getting involved in football at an ever-younger age.

    to the hubris that others who have dealt with mathematical models and economics
    have.

    This book is a good look into where some of the names and constructs in Objective-C and Ruby come from.

    Some of the patterns and recommendations are strictly a result of the idiosyncrasies of Smalltalk and working within the average Smalltalk browser.

    Oddly most enlightening for me were the code formatting recommendations which assumed using line wrapping in a browser.

  review: This is more of an anthology of Gladwell's articles than a book on a single

  review: |+
    Thought provoking book. Some points:

    Many of the top performing countries invest little in learning technology favoring investment in pedagogy, teachers who entered training to be teachers after being in the top of their class. They invest in equity of students, but also raise the performance overall via rigor and allowing students to fail early and to accept failure, rather than discover failure once they're out in the real world.

    Instead, many of our schools are distracted by technological toys and sports programs, having to hire teachers who can coach, rather than solely on the basis of teaching skill. Half of US high school math teachers didn't even major in math. Nearly a third didn't even minor in math.

  review: |-
    Interesting to hear his insight into psychopathy, but the tone and aims of the book weren't consistent.

    In many ways this book reads like a failed attempt to water down a PhD paper to the level of the average reader.

    In other cases this book reads like a doomsday book about the end times with psychopaths becoming an increasing proportion of society.

    The book could have been better if it didn't sound like it was written by a disgruntled scientist whose work didn't get any respect.

    Rand somehow manages to develop almost every character to be hated. I don't know how that is possible.

    If you're looking for the philosophy core of Rand's, just jump to John Galt's radio speech near the end.

    As a work of philosophy, this work has merit, but I'd recommend a book such as Thinking: Fast and Slow to temper the philosophy.

    Fascinating picture of the political landscape and Civil War in 1864, including:
    - Political deals within the administration.
    - Favors granted.
    - Incompetence of the efforts of the Union.
    - The general cowardice of many people in the Northern political parties.
    - The bias of newspapers.
    - Attitudes towards the slaves on both sides.

    Libertarian paternalism: Interesting thoughts on how to get people to do what's best for them or do the "right thing" without sacrificing their freedom of choice, by "nudging" people's "automatic system" of their brain.

    Nutrition, spending, retirement saving, charitable giving, Medicare drug plans, urinals...

    The second half of the book addresses ways to engage your own "reflective system" to nudge the "automatic system" in order to make positive changes in your habits.

    The last few chapters also seem to stretch the concept of the book a little beyond where it should have went.

    Excellent examination of the fallacies and shortcuts constructed by the mind that often cause errors in judgment. This book approaches demonstration of the judgment errors by getting the reader to catch himself in the act of erring and then deconstructing the error and why it happened.

    This book is like an extended encyclopedia entry of the concepts in Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's work, Nassim Nicholas Taleb's Black Swan, and Phil Rosenzweig's The Halo Effect, and (while not mentioned) The Paradox of Choice.

    This is a fairly loaded book that probably has added value on repeat readings, and I will be revisiting the book in the future.

  review: |-
    I often hear comparisons of the recession/panic of 2008 with the Great Depression redirected to a comparison with the Panic of 1907.

    In terms of character, duration, and impetus, I would have to agree that the characterization of 2008 as a panic similar to 1907 make sense.

    This book was released in August 31, 2007 and makes reference [in the Coda] to "oil rising to $100 per barrel" and uncertainty whether credit derivatives would dampen or amplify a panic.

    The conclusions in the book point to several ingredients in creating a perfect storm for a panic, but also admit to a Keynesian bias in presenting preventative measures and corrective action.

    The narrative is interesting if [necessarily] dry, and while the construction of the cause thesis is reasonable, the conclusions didn't seem to follow through.

    This book is available on Audible.

    This book is a challenge to get through, even in audiobook form.  I had a basic familiarity with the story of Les Misérables from the musical of the same name.

    The depth of Jean Valjean's character and circumstances is so much greater than could ever be remotely given justice by the movie or any musical representation.

    I would recommend this for anyone who is in love with the story as presented by the musical.  The original version of the story has a completely different dimension than any 2-3 hour production can present.

    The unabridged format is a bit unwieldy, but provides some measure of context, considering how far displaced we are from the original setting of the story.

    training shoes. The Trial of Miles; Miles of Trials."'

  review: "Maybe the dated internet boom references caused problems for me, but I
    wasn't impressed with this book. \n\nMaybe the whole virus/sneezing metaphor was
    just too weird for me."

  review: Amazingly, the things that appealed to me in this book should be business
    common sense, such as rejecting the idea of a mission statement and the "false
    apology".  I wish this were a staple of corporate culture instead of pop business
    books.

  review: |-
    I started this book just because I was looking for something to read via Audible.com. I continued on reading due to having already used the credit in my account and because I needed something to listen to while running, anyway.

    The original edition contains dated scientific references, among other things. A majority of the book is written in a formal style, such that it reads as a textbook, but without actual authority behind it.

    There are some inspirational moments and prescriptive details in the book, but the book starts and finishes in the realm of the surreal.

    I actually ended up enjoying the cultural oddities preserved in a 70 year old book, which got me through it.
