  commentary: Written in the early days of Ruby popularity between 1.8.6 and 1.9.3, this book by the Prawn author contains some good tidbits despite its dated commentary. Reminiscing about the days of RubyForge among others.

  commentary: Fairly rudimentary coverage of the concepts, but good intro if you're fairly new to GA. Not related to the content, but I don't recommend illustration/figure-heavy PragProg books on O'Reilly App.
